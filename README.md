Ideas for game:
2-D
shoot em up style side scroller, Or bullet hell
ideas for mechanics:
all shapes, the more sides a shape has the more dangerous it is, or fractals, the higher the dimmension between 1.0 and 2.0 the greater the danger
mechanics needed:
health, damage, projectiles, powerups/upgrades? (maybe sides can represent health and each time an enemy (or you) gets hit you lose a side)
points system
  -either points for every time you hit an enemy or points for killing it
spawning system for enemies
movement system for enemies
  -pathfinding
control system for player
  -WASD plus keyboard
render system
  -LWJGL
Bosses?
  -big complex shape
menu system
settings for low/medium/high system requirements?
  -2d is not super demanding so we don't really need this?
  -Just set frame and logic updates to a specific number i.e. 60 a second
royalty-free music and sound effects
  -could make our own
animations for enemies and player
  -if simple shapes then just rotate shape
background?
  -could draw or could set pixels to change color in a pattern/randomnly 
 Physics engine 
  -if top down super simple, mostly controlling speed of objects
  

Tools requested:
Git and GitKraken for version control
Gitlab/Github for repository
eclipse for java development
lwjgl

for sound:
audacity for audio file creation
Frooty loops if someone has it

for art:
inkscape so we can use vector graphics to scale the resolution of the game to match its window
Gimp/Sketchbook/Manga Studio for graphics
Pixel based graphics would probably be easier
Use a set resolution across all platforms
