Ideas for game:
2-D
shoot em up style side scroller
ideas for mechanics:
all shapes, the more sides a shape has the more dangerous it is, or fractals, the higher the dimmension between 1.0 and 2.0 the greater the danger
mechanics needed:
health, damage, projectiles, powerups/upgrades? (maybe sides can represent health and each time an enemy (or you) gets hit you lose a side)
points system
spawning system for enemies
movement system for enemies
control system for player
render system
Bosses?
menu system
settings for low/medium/high system requirements?
royalty-free music and sound effects
animations for enemies and player
background?

Tools requested:
Git and GitKraken for version control
Gitlab/Github for repository
eclipse for java development
lwjgl

for sound:
audacity for audio file creation

for art:
inkscape so we can use vector graphics to scale the resolution of the game to match its window
